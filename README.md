# ECLAT Algorithm for Frequent Itemsets
This is a group final project on implementing an ECLAT algorithm to mine frequent itemsets. We take motivation from Philippe Fournier-Viger [courses](https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/COURSES/Pattern_mining/index.php).

The source code is provided in DataMining-Group2/Code/eclat_algo.py. For demonstration, see DataMining-Group2/Code/main.ipynb

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Dr. Nguyen An Te for guidance on this project. You have given valuable knowledge on not just the subject of Association Rule Mining but Data Mining as whole. We can confidently say that this project wouldn't have been possible if not for your guidance.
